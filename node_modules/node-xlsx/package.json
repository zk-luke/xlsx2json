Please read it carefully.\n\nAn opensource alternative is currently being developped by [Niggler](https://github.com/Niggler/js-xlsx), reader-only for now.\n\nQuick start\n-----------\n\nParsing a xlsx from file/buffer\n``` javascript\nvar xlsx = require('node-xlsx');\n\nvar obj = xlsx.parse(__dirname + '/myFile.xlsx'); // parses a file\n\nvar obj = xlsx.parse(fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/myFile.xlsx')); // parses a buffer\n\n```\n\nBuilding a plist from an object\n``` javascript\nvar xlsx = require('node-xlsx');\n\nvar buffer = xlsx.build({worksheets: [\n  {\"name\":\"mySheetName\", \"data\":[\n    [\"A1\", \"B1\"],\n    [\n      {\"value\":\"A2\",\"formatCode\":\"General\"},\n      {\"value\":\"B2\",\"formatCode\":\"General\"}\n    ]\n  ]}\n]}); // returns a buffer\n\n```\n\nTesting\n-------\n\n`node-xlsx` is tested with `nodeunit`.\n\n>\n\tnpm install --dev\n\tnpm test\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPlease submit all pull requests the against master branch. If your unit test contains javascript patches or features, you should include relevant unit tests.
